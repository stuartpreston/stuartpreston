### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there 

I'm [Stuart Preston](https://stuartpreston.net), a technologist who lives in the beautiful [City of York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York) in the north of England. I have worked in positions all the way from Trainee/Helpdesk to CTO but these days I focus on building product, the world of open source and anything to do with the Microsoft ecosystem in general. I am currently employed at VMware. âœ¨
