### 👋 Hey there 

I'm [Stuart Preston](https://stuartpreston.net), a technologist with more than two decades in industry. I live in the United Kingdom. 🇬🇧

I have worked in positions all the way from Helpdesk to CTO and I enjoy the process of building product, open source and anything to do with the Microsoft ecosystem in general. ✨

✨ I have been a Microsoft MVP since 2016, advocating for the world of open-source and the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.

💬 Ask me about how I founded a consultancy but ended up working full time at [Chef Software](https://chef.io).

📚 I wrote a [book](http://pendrica.github.io/using-chef-with-microsoft-azure/) about Chef and the Microsoft Azure.

👨🏼‍💻 I am a maintainer for [Test Kitchen](https://github.com/test-kitchen) and the [Test Kitchen driver for Microsoft Azure Resource Manager](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-azurerm) as well as being a former contributor to multiple projects including [Chef](https://github.com/chef/chef).

⚡ Fun fact: [I wrote the original Windows Vista gadget for the UK's National Rail Enquiries](http://www.darrenstraight.com/blog/images/2007/08/nationalrail_gadget.jpg) and am a secret railfan :)
