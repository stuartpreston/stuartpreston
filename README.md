### 👋 Hey there 

I'm [Stuart Preston](https://stuartpreston.net), a technologist with more than two decades in industry. I live in the beautiful [City of York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York) in the north of England. From a career perspective, I have worked in positions all the way from Trainee/Helpdesk to CTO. These days I focus on building product, the world of open source and anything to do with the Microsoft ecosystem in general. ✨

✨ Microsoft MVP for Azure since 2016.

📚 I wrote a [book](http://pendrica.github.io/using-chef-with-microsoft-azure/) all about automation using Infrastructure as Code with Chef and the Microsoft Azure.

👨🏼‍💻 I am a maintainer for [Test Kitchen](https://github.com/test-kitchen) and the [Test Kitchen driver for Microsoft Azure Resource Manager](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-azurerm) as well as being a former contributor to multiple projects at [Chef](https://github.com/chef/chef).

⚡ Fun fact: [I wrote the original Windows Vista gadget for the UK's National Rail Enquiries](http://www.darrenstraight.com/blog/images/2007/08/nationalrail_gadget.jpg) in 2006, well before there was a public web service endpoint. Secret railfan :)
